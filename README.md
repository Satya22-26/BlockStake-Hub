# 🎉 BlockStake Hub 🎉

BlockStake Hub is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to stake ERC20 tokens and earn rewards. The staking process generates reward tokens continuously, rewarding users based on the amount they stake and the duration of their stake.

## 🚀 ERC20 Tokens


### 🔐 Stake Token

The Stake Token is the ERC20 token used for staking within the DApp. Users need to approve this token for the staking contract before staking.

### 🎁 Reward Token

The Reward Token is another ERC20 token generated by the staking process per second. Users earn these tokens as rewards for staking their stake tokens.

## ✨ Features

### 🛠️ Staking Tokens

- **Authorize Stake Tokens**: Users must authorize a specific amount of stake tokens for staking within the DApp by interacting with the staking smart contract.

### 💰 Reward Generation

- **Create Reward Tokens**: When stake tokens are staked, the smart contract produces reward tokens every second based on the staked amount.

### 📈 Reward Accumulation

- **Earn Rewards Over Time**: Users earn reward tokens over time as their stake tokens remain staked within the DApp.

### 🏆 Claiming Rewards

- **Retrieve Accumulated Rewards**: Users can claim their earned rewards by interacting with the smart contract through the `getReward()` function.

### 🔓 Unstaking Tokens

- **Withdraw Stake Tokens**: Users can unstake their tokens after a specific period or at any time, retrieving their staked tokens along with the accumulated rewards by using the appropriate function in the DApp.
